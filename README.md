# Personal Dashboard
This project is a clone of the Chrome's Momentum dashboard and was originally completed on Scrimba's learning platform. It displays the current time, current weather, a random inspirational quote, and a random nature-themed background image with attribution.

Two of the API calls (Unsplash and Open Weather Map) that require an access key are made through scrimba.com. This makes it easier for someone practicing working with APIs to access data. 

## Built With
Async JavaScript 
HTML/CSS

## Use
It is currently used as a chrome extension.

## ToDos
- Store and retrieve data in a cache, rather than requesting from the servers every time (for generating a random quote or image). Can use local storage or Cache API.
